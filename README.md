## Business Logic

### YRTC Kearney Exclusion
The application specifically excludes "YRTC Kearney" from all public listings as per requirements.

### Status Management
- Providers can only update facilities assigned to their account
- Status changes are timestamped
- Five status options available:
  - Openings Available
  - No Openings
  - Waitlist
  - Accepting Assessments
  - Emergency/Crisis Only

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Set up Firebase (Required for Provider Portal)**
   - Follow the detailed instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`
   - Create a Firebase project in Google Cloud Console
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore
   - Get your Firebase configuration

3. **Configure API keys**
   - Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google Maps API key
   - Replace Firebase configuration placeholders with your actual Firebase config
   - Ensure Google Maps API key has Geocoding API and Maps JavaScript API enabled

4. **Open the application**
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser for the public interface
   - Open `provider-signin.html` to access the provider portal

5. **For production deployment**
   - Serve through HTTPS (required for Firebase Auth)
   - Update Firestore security rules for production
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Security Considerations

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure Google Cloud-based authentication with email verification
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Database access controlled by user authentication and authorization
- **API Key Protection**: Google Maps and Firebase API keys should be restricted by domain/IP in Google Cloud Console
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **HTTPS**: Required for Firebase Auth and recommended for all production deployments
- **Configuration**: Sensitive configuration separated from code (config.js not in version control)
- **Email Verification**: Users must verify their email addresses before accessing the system
- **Admin Approval**: New provider accounts require admin approval before activation

## Future Enhancements

This prototype demonstrates the core functionality. In a production environment, consider:

- Backend API with proper authentication
- Database integration (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Real user management system
- Admin panel for facility management
- Email notifications for status changes
- Advanced search capabilities
- Mobile app development
- Integration with mapping services
- Analytics and reporting features

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
