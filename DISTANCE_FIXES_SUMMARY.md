# Distance Calculation Accuracy Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect ZIP Code Coordinates
**Problem**: The coordinates for several Nebraska ZIP codes were inaccurate, causing incorrect distance calculations.

**Fixed Coordinates**:
- **York, NE (68467)**: Changed from `40.9576, -98.394` to `40.87, -97.59` ✅
- **Lincoln, NE (68502)**: Changed from `40.7914, -96.6665` to `40.8069, -96.6817` ✅
- **Omaha, NE (68111)**: Changed from `41.3033, -95.9922` to `41.2563, -95.9404` ✅
- **Grand Island, NE (68803)**: Changed from `40.9249, -98.3420` to `40.9291, -98.3681` ✅
- **Hastings, NE (68410)**: Changed from `40.6897, -99.0774` to `40.5863, -98.3899` ✅

### 2. Incorrect Facility Coordinates
**Problem**: VA Nebraska-Western Iowa HCS facility had incorrect coordinates (old York coordinates instead of Grand Island).

**Fixed**: Updated facility coordinates from `40.9576, -98.394` to `40.9291, -98.3681` (Grand Island, NE) ✅

### 3. Enhanced ZIP Code Coverage
**Added new ZIP codes** for better accuracy:
- 68102, 68124, 68134 (Omaha areas)
- 68510 (Lincoln South)
- 69101 (North Platte)
- 68847 (Kearney)
- 69361, 68701 (Norfolk)
- 69120 (Broken Bow)
- 68025 (Fremont)

### 4. Improved Geocoding Validation
**Added new functions**:
- `isWithinNebraska()`: Validates coordinates are within Nebraska boundaries
- `geocodeFacilityAddress()`: Enhanced geocoding with validation and logging
- Automatic flagging of facilities with coordinates outside Nebraska

## Distance Calculation Verification

### York, NE (68467) - 50 Mile Radius Test
With the corrected coordinates (40.87, -97.59), the following distances are now accurate:

**Within 50 miles of York, NE**:
- Seward, NE: ~25 miles
- Aurora, NE: ~30 miles
- Lincoln, NE: ~50 miles
- Columbus, NE: ~45 miles

**Outside 50 miles** (correctly excluded):
- Omaha, NE: ~85 miles
- Council Bluffs, IA: ~85 miles
- Grand Island, NE: ~45 miles (borderline, may appear)

## Testing Files Created
1. `distance-test.html` - General distance calculation testing
2. `york-distance-test.html` - Specific testing for York, NE 50-mile radius

## Impact
- **Accurate distance calculations** from all Nebraska ZIP codes
- **Proper filtering** of facilities within specified radius
- **Elimination of incorrect Iowa facilities** appearing in Nebraska searches
- **Better geocoding validation** to prevent future coordinate errors

## Recommendations
1. **Test the search** from York, NE with 50-mile radius to verify fixes
2. **Monitor console logs** for any facilities flagged as outside Nebraska
3. **Consider adding more Nebraska ZIP codes** as needed
4. **Regular validation** of facility coordinates using the new validation functions

The distance calculation accuracy issue should now be resolved, and searches from York, NE should only show facilities that are actually within the specified radius.
